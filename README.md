My focus has shifted, and I primarily work as a Shopify developer, creating and customizing e-commerce experiences for clients. Alongside this, I also worked with React.js and WordPress for various website projects.<br/><br/>

Did a test task on Angular and TS for parsing a file that user will drop in UI. task was to display some certificate's data in the app UI and store it in local storage. 8 days to finish it, that was a hard one. result is a little buggy, but works. <br/><br/>

I've started to learn the TypeScript + Tailwind separately. Base app for practicing will be: https://forseti93.github.io/time-manager-app/ <br/>
At the same time I look for a job, because of the test task has the highest priority, this app writing is paused often.
